# COVID-19 immunity certificate research and implementations

A central repository collecting links to research about and implementations of COVID-19 immunity certificates, also known as immunity passports, corona passes, recovery certificates, release certificates, etc.  Contributions are welcome.

## Key open questions

What policy makers need to know about COVID-19 protective immunity: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30985-5/fulltext

### Do recovered patients have protective immunity?

* "Study Finds Nearly Everyone Who Recovers From COVID-19 Makes Coronavirus Antibodies": https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350462
* "Studies of COVID-19 show that 10â€“20% of symptomatically infected people have little or no detectable antibody": https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382
* "A study of survivors of SARS showed that about 90% had functional, virus-neutralising antibodies and around 50% had strong T-lymphocyte responses": https://www.jimmunol.org/content/181/8/5490
* "South Korea's central clinical committee for emerging disease control said there was no live virus present in all 277 recovered but tested-positive cases, positively refuting theories like the virus being reactivated or reinfection": https://m-en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200429007051320

### How long does immunity last?

* "The best estimate comes from the closely related coronaviruses and suggests that, in people who had an antibody response, immunity might wane, but is detectable beyond 1 year after hospitalisation." https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/3/04-0906_article

### Are current antibody (serology) tests reliable?

* No: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01115-z

## Ethical issues

* Risk of people being forced to take tests or lose job
* Risk of people intentionally infecting themselves to acquire immunity certificates
* Risk of creating a black market of forged or otherwise falsified immunity certificates

## Countries

### Already issuing certificates
